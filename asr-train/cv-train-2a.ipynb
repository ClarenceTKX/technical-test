    "As seen in the train/loss graph, the local minima for the `wav2vec2-large-960h-cv` fine-tuning attempts hovered at around 3.05. Peaks were observed between steps 6,000 to 8,000 but had hit minima range shortly after 8,000 steps. The loss remained relatively constant around the minima region as observed across >8,000 steps, and training was stopped at 16,300 steps after observing that no other minimisation would occur.\n",
    "This is consistent with `wav2vec2-large-960h`'s documentation on facebook's model card, where \"(w)hen lowering the amount of labeled data to one hour, wav2vec 2.0 outperforms the previous state of the art on the 100 hour subset while using 100 times less labeled data\". \n",
